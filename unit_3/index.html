	<p>We were founded in 2008 after Krab Kardashian, a cousin of Kim, wanted to rent alligators for his baby's dog's engagement party but couldn't find a high-quality rental company. Here are just some of our prestigious clients:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dougie Hanks, Tom's nephew</li>
		<li>One of the dogs who played Lassie</li>
		<li>A very nice car</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We hope you will consider engaging our services for your high-society function.</p>
